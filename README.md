# CodeGenerator

## This code allows users to generate a password, in a clear and simple format. The user is prompted with password criteria, options for letter casing, as well as directions on how to proceed if an error was made. My first code allows users to see the options avaliable for generating their passwords, such as avaliable characters, letters, and casing. Once the user decides how they would prefer their password to be styled, the click the "Generate Password" button and they have their very own generated password ready for their use.


# My Code Excecution


## For this given objective, I created a library of arrays that I called upon in a generatePassword function(). The code prompted the user to decide how many characters were going to be used by the random number generator. The output of the code correctly displayed that I understood how to use "if" statements and "for loops" to generate a random string from multiple indexes. 

# My Project Experience 

## I was faced with many roadblocks while working through this code, a few of which were small mistakes that had large effects on the overall page function. One of the early mistakes I made was using an uppercase "U" and "L" in the words "lower" and "upper", as well as adding the word "case" to the end of each of these words. I could not figure out why my code was not functioning properly and allowing the user to proceed with the questions, and it took me hours to finally see such a small detail made a very big difference in the code. This was an awesome lesson to learn, never get too comfortable or confident and overlook any aspect of your work. All pieces large or small, must come together just right to complete this puzzle that is coding. I am looking forward to using and building upon the skills gained from this challenging yet interesting Password Generator assignment.
